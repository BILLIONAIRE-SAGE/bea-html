        Why you no dey get my time?
        Is there someone else?
        You dey do me cunny o
        Every day new story o
        Shey I just dey waste my time 
        Cos you dun
        become someone else
        See palava for me o
        You no dey touch my body o
        It feels good to
        
        Love somebody
        And somebody loves you back
        But it feels one-sided now
        It feels one-sided now
        You don't have to
        Pretend about it
        Cause it's crystal clear now now
        Guess it's bye to the good times
        I'll be gone by the sunrise
        I'll be better all on my own
        I'll be better all on my own, na , na 
        Nobody should call my phone
        Nobody should call my phone, na, na
        This is my last heartbreak song
        This is my last heartbreak song, na , na 
        I'll be good all on my own
        I'll be good all on my own, na , na 
        Why are you so quick to leave?
        When we both could make it work?
        When I'm gone I make you nervous
        If you hurt me I deserve it
        I've been acting foolishly
        Forgetting what you're worth
        You've stopped loving me, I noticed
        But even chaos serves a purpose
        It feels good to
        Love somebody
        And somebody loves you back
        So don't give in to your changed mind
        Cause I'll be here for a lifetime
        You don't have to pretend about it
        Cause it's crystal clear now now
        Guess it's bye to the good times
        And I'll be gone by the sunrise
        I'll be better on my own
        I'll be better on my own, na , na 
        Nobody should call my phone
        Nobody should call my phone, na , na 
        This is my last heartbreak song
        This is my last heartbreak song, na , na
        I'll be good on my own
        I'll be good on my own, na , na
